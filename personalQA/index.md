### Q2: Can you explain the gap in your academic and career journey?

A: Yes, I had a 2-year academic gap and a career gap after graduation. Here's a brief explanation of both:

| **Academic Year** | **Explanation** |
|-------------------|------------|
| 1st Year (Aug 2016 â€“ Jun 2017) | I relocated for my studies, and adjusting to the new environment took time. I couldnâ€™t focus properly and ended up with a backlog . |
| 2nd Year (Aug 2017 â€“ Jun 2018) | I was under pressure managing both the backlog and new subjects. This led to a year down in 2018. |
| Gap (Aug 2018 â€“ Jun 2020) |  I completed the Certified IT Architect (CITA) course from CMS IT Services (Jun â€“ Dec 2019), building foundational IT skills. |
| COVID Phase (2020 â€“ 2021) |  I used this time to clear my backlogs through online exams. Our college also migrated to a new university (XYZ University), and I completed my remaining years, graduating in 2022. |

ðŸ’¼ Career Gap (Post-Graduation):
After graduation, I enrolled in a Software Testing Course (July â€“ Dec 2022) where I learned Manual & Automation Testing using Selenium, Core Java, and enhanced my HTML/CSS skills.
