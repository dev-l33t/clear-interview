### Q2: Can you explain the gap in your academic and career journey?

A: Yes, I had a 2-year academic gap and a career gap after graduation. Here's a brief explanation of both:

| **Academic Year** | **Explanation** |
|-------------------|------------|
| 1st Year (Aug 2016 – Jun 2017) | I relocated for my studies, and adjusting to the new environment took time. I couldn’t focus properly and ended up with a backlog . |
| 2nd Year (Aug 2017 – Jun 2018) | I was under pressure managing both the backlog and new subjects. This led to a year down in 2018. |
| Gap (Aug 2018 – Jun 2020) |  I completed the Certified IT Architect (CITA) course from CMS IT Services (Jun – Dec 2019), building foundational IT skills. |
| COVID Phase (2020 – 2021) |  I used this time to clear my backlogs through online exams. Our college also migrated to a new university (XYZ University), and I completed my remaining years, graduating in 2022. |

💼 Career Gap (Post-Graduation):
After graduation, I enrolled in a Software Testing Course (July – Dec 2022) where I learned Manual & Automation Testing using Selenium, Core Java, and enhanced my HTML/CSS skills.

---

### Q3: You’ve spent over two years focusing on self-improvement after graduation. Can you explain how you used that time and what you achieved?
**A:**  
  Yes, I understand that it might seem like a long time. 
  After graduating in **2022**, I joined a **software testing course** from **July to December 2022**, where I learned **manual and automation testing** using **Selenium and   Core Java**. After that, I used this time effectively:

  - Focused on **interview preparation** and **communication skills**.
  - Built a solid **portfolio** with **real-time testing projects**.
  - Practiced [**test case writing**](https://pratiks-desk.site/test-cases/practiced-testcases/#sanity-testing), **bug reporting**, and **scenario-based testing** regularly.
  - Kept learning through **online tutorials, mock interviews**, and peer feedback.

  I didn’t want to rush into a job. I aimed to be **fully job-ready** — both technically and personally.  
  Now, I feel confident and excited to begin my career in software testing.

# 📘 Java Quick Notes (Beginner → Intermediate)

## 1. Basics

* **Java = OOP language** (Object-Oriented Programming).
* **Platform Independent** → Write once, run anywhere (JVM).
* **Case-sensitive**.
* `.java` → source code, `.class` → bytecode.

## 2. Data Types

* **Primitive (8 types)**

  * byte (1 byte), short (2), int (4), long (8), float (4), double (8), char (2), boolean (1).
* **Non-primitive** → String, Arrays, Classes, Objects.

## 3. Variables

* Types → local, instance, static.
* Final → constant, value can’t change.
* Static → belongs to class, not object.

## 4. Operators

* Arithmetic: `+ - * / %`
* Relational: `== != < > <= >=`
* Logical: `&& || !`
* Assignment: `= += -= *= /=`
* Unary: `++ --`
* Ternary: `(condition) ? true : false`

## 5. Control Statements

* **if-else, switch-case**
* **Loops**: for, while, do-while
* **break** → exit loop, **continue** → skip current iteration

## 6. OOPs Concepts

* **Class**: Blueprint of object.
* **Object**: Instance of class.
* **Encapsulation**: Bind data + methods. (use private + getters/setters).
* **Inheritance**: Reuse parent class properties (`extends`).
* **Polymorphism**:

  * Compile time (method overloading).
  * Runtime (method overriding).
* **Abstraction**: Hiding details, showing only essentials. (abstract class, interface).

## 7. Keywords

* `this` → current object.
* `super` → parent class.
* `final` → variable (constant), method (can’t override), class (can’t extend).
* `static` → class level.
* `abstract` → incomplete method/class.
* `synchronized` → thread-safe.
* `transient` → not serialized.
* `volatile` → variable updated by multiple threads.

## 8. Strings

* Immutable (can’t change).
* Created by `" "` or `new`.
* Important methods: `length()`, `charAt()`, `substring()`, `equals()`, `compareTo()`, `toLowerCase()`, `toUpperCase()`.

## 9. Arrays

# 📘 Complete Java Notes (Detailed + Beginner Friendly)

---

## 1. Introduction to Java

* Java is a **high-level, object-oriented, secure, and platform-independent language** developed by Sun Microsystems (1995).
* It compiles code into **bytecode** which runs on the **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**.
* Known for *portability* → *“Write Once, Run Anywhere”*.

---

## 2. Java Architecture (JDK, JRE, JVM)

* **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)** → executes bytecode, makes Java platform-independent.
* **JRE (Java Runtime Environment)** → JVM + libraries to run programs.
* **JDK (Java Development Kit)** → JRE + tools like compiler, debugger (for development).

---

## 3. Data Types in Java

* **Primitive (8 types):**

  * byte (1 byte), short (2), int (4), long (8) → integers.
  * float (4), double (8) → decimals.
  * char (2) → single character.
  * boolean (1 bit) → true/false.
* **Non-Primitive:** Strings, Arrays, Classes, Interfaces, Objects.

---

## 4. Variables

* **Local Variables** → declared inside methods, exist during method execution.
* **Instance Variables** → object-specific, stored in heap memory.
* **Static Variables** → shared across all objects, memory-efficient.
* **Final Variables** → constants, cannot change after initialization.

---

## 5. Operators

* **Arithmetic** → `+ - * / %`
* **Relational** → `== != > < <= >=`
* **Logical** → `&& || !`
* **Assignment** → `= += -= *= /=`
* **Unary** → `++ --` (increment/decrement)
* **Ternary** → `(condition) ? trueValue : falseValue`

---

## 6. Control Statements

* **if-else** → decision making.
* **switch-case** → multiple options based on a value.
* **Loops:**

  * for → known iterations.
  * while → condition-based loop.
  * do-while → runs at least once.
* **break** → exits loop, **continue** → skips current iteration.

---

## 7. OOPs Concepts in Java

Java follows **4 main pillars of OOP**:

1. **Encapsulation**

   * Binding data and methods into a single unit (class).
   * Achieved using **private variables + public getters/setters**.

2. **Inheritance**

   * Acquiring properties of one class into another (`extends`).
   * Promotes **code reusability**.
   * Types: single, multilevel, hierarchical (Java doesn’t support multiple inheritance directly).

3. **Polymorphism**

   * **Compile-time (Overloading):** Same method name, different parameters.
   * **Runtime (Overriding):** Subclass provides specific implementation of parent class method.

4. **Abstraction**

   * Hiding internal details, showing only essential features.
   * Achieved using **abstract classes** (incomplete methods) and **interfaces**.

---

## 8. Important Keywords

* **this** → refers to current object.
* **super** → calls parent class constructor/method.
* **final** → makes constants, prevents inheritance or overriding.
* **static** → class-level keyword (variables, methods).
* **abstract** → defines incomplete methods/classes.
* **synchronized** → ensures thread safety.
* **volatile** → variable value updated by multiple threads.
* **transient** → skips variable during serialization.

---

## 9. Strings

* **Immutable:** Once created, values cannot change.
* Declared as `"Hello"` or `new String("Hello")`.
* **Important Methods:**

  * `length()`, `charAt(i)`, `substring()`, `equals()`, `compareTo()`, `concat()`, `toLowerCase()`, `toUpperCase()`.
* For **mutable strings**, Java provides **StringBuilder & StringBuffer**.

---

## 10. Arrays

* **Definition:** Fixed-size collection of same type elements stored in sequence.
* Example: `int arr[] = new int[5];`
* Types:

  * Single Dimensional (`int arr[]`).
  * Multi-Dimensional (`int arr[][]`).
* Traversed using normal `for` or `for-each` loop.

---

## 11. Exception Handling

* **Definition:** Mechanism to handle runtime errors gracefully.
* **Keywords:**

  * `try` → code to test.
  * `catch` → handle exception.
  * `finally` → always executes (cleanup).
  * `throw` → manually throw exception.
  * `throws` → declare exceptions in method signature.
* **Types:**

  * Checked (compile-time) → e.g., IOException.
  * Unchecked (runtime) → e.g., NullPointerException.

---

## 12. Collections Framework

* Provides **ready-made data structures** for storing/managing data.
* **List** (ordered, allows duplicates): `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`.
* **Set** (unique elements, no duplicates): `HashSet`, `TreeSet`.
* **Map** (key-value pairs): `HashMap`, `TreeMap`.
* **Queue** (FIFO): `PriorityQueue`, `Deque`.

---

## 13. Multithreading

* **Definition:** Executing multiple tasks simultaneously.
* **Creating Threads:**

  1. Extending `Thread` class and overriding `run()`.
  2. Implementing `Runnable` interface.
* **Important Methods:** `start()`, `run()`, `sleep()`, `join()`.
* **Synchronization:** prevents data inconsistency when multiple threads access shared resources.

---

## 14. File Handling (I/O in Java)

* Java provides **java.io** package for file operations.
* **Classes:**

  * `File` → represents file.
  * `FileReader`, `FileWriter` → read/write.
  * `BufferedReader`, `BufferedWriter` → efficient reading/writing.
* **try-with-resources** → auto-closes files after use.

---

## 15. Java 8 Features

* **Lambda Expressions:** `(a, b) -> a + b`, shorter anonymous methods.
* **Functional Interfaces:** Interfaces with a single abstract method (`@FunctionalInterface`).
* **Streams API:** Process collections (filter, map, reduce) in functional style.
* **Default Methods:** Allow methods with body in interfaces.
* **Date & Time API (java.time):** Improved date handling.

---

## 16. Memory Management

* **Stack Memory:** Stores method calls and local variables.
* **Heap Memory:** Stores objects and instance variables.
* **Garbage Collector (GC):** Automatically deletes unused objects.
* **Reference types:** Strong, weak, soft, phantom references.

---

## 17. Access Modifiers

* **public** → accessible everywhere.
* **protected** → accessible in same package + subclasses.
* **default (no keyword)** → accessible only in same package.
* **private** → accessible only within the class.

---

## 18. Differences (Common Interview Qs)

* **JDK vs JRE vs JVM:** JDK = development tools, JRE = runtime, JVM = executor.
* **Overloading vs Overriding:** Overloading → same method name, diff parameters (compile-time). Overriding → same method signature, redefined in child (runtime).
* **Abstract Class vs Interface:** Abstract class can have abstract + non-abstract methods; interface has only abstract methods (till Java 7, Java 8 added default methods).
* **String vs StringBuilder vs StringBuffer:** String → immutable, StringBuilder → mutable, not thread-safe, StringBuffer → mutable, thread-safe.
